Code for the analysis of the relationship between the mass of black holes in galaxies and the velocity dispersion. This relationship is useful for multi-messanger detection. 

Uses Scikit-Learn and AstroML to fit various linear and polynomial regressions to data from the McConnell and Ma 2013 paper and the Illustris Simulation. Focused on systems with supermassive black hole binary systems that would produce graviational waves that would be detectable by the Pulsar Timing Array.
